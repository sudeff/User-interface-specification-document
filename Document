 User Management Interface Specification 
Purpose
This document outlines the layout, components, and behavior of the User Management Interface. It is intended for developers tasked with implementing this interface using a frontend framework and integrating it with backend APIs.

Interface Sections
1. User List Panel (Left Side)
Contains a “+ New User” button to open the user creation form.

Includes a checkbox labeled “Hide Disabled User” to filter the list by active users.

Displays a data table with the following columns:

ID: Automatically generated numeric identifier.

User Name: The account username.

Email: User's registered email.

Enabled: A true/false flag indicating whether the account is active.

Each column supports sorting and filtering.
Clicking on any user row opens that user's data in the form on the right.

2. User Details Form (Right Side)
This panel supports both user creation and editing.

Form Fields:

Username: Required; must be unique.

Display Name: Optional.

Phone: Optional; should follow a valid phone format.

Email: Required; must be in correct format.

User Roles: Dropdown allowing selection of one or more roles:

Guest

Admin

SuperAdmin

Enabled: Checkbox that controls account activation.

Buttons & Behaviors:

Save User button: Validates input and saves the form.

Form validation rules:

Username and email must not be empty.

Email must be properly formatted.

Duplicate usernames should be prevented with a warning.

UI Logic & Behaviors
When the page loads, only users marked as enabled (Enabled = true) are shown.

Clicking “+ New User” clears the right panel for data entry.

Clicking an existing user row fills the form with that user’s information.

Toggling “Hide Disabled User” dynamically filters the table.

After saving, the table should refresh to reflect changes.

Development Notes
This UI can be developed using technologies like React, Angular, or Vue.

Backend should provide user CRUD APIs and role list.

Ensure responsive design and accessibility where possible.
